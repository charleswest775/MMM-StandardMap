/* The standard map (Chirikov 1969, 1979): a rotor, free but for a kick once a period whose
 * strength depends on the angle it is at. Its angle θ and its spin p from one kick to the next:
 *   p' = p + K sin θ,   θ' = θ + p'     (both mod 2π)
 * The simplest system in which order and chaos live side by side. Each orbit is plotted as the
 * dots of its first 2,000 kicks: a regular one draws a closed curve (a KAM torus) or a chain of
 * islands, a chaotic one scatters dust over the region it can reach.
 *
 * The map keeps area (its Jacobian's determinant is 1), like every Hamiltonian flow. For small K
 * most of the picture is curves that span θ from side to side: barriers no orbit can cross.
 * The last of them, the one turning by the golden mean each kick, breaks at K = 0.971635
 * (Greene 1979); beyond it a chaotic orbit can wander from any spin to any other.
 *
 * An orbit is chaotic or not by its Lyapunov exponent, the average log of how much it
 * stretches a small displacement each kick, taken from the tangent map alongside it.
 *
 * Drawn for the Pi: a whole orbit at a time, three a second, and nothing between; the dots of an
 * orbit are spread over the whole canvas, so what costs is how often the canvas changes, not how
 * much. Rests once the picture is done.
